        "This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of the Flipkart Customer Support dataset, delivering a full spectrum of data science workflow from initial exploration to predictive modeling. The first half of the project is a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which involves rigorous data cleaning, imputation of missing values, and the creation of 15 visualizations to uncover key patterns. Insights from the EDA reveal that customer satisfaction is generally high, with 'Order Related' issues being the most common reason for contact. The second half transitions to predictive modeling, beginning with formal hypothesis testing to statistically validate observations made during EDA. A thorough feature engineering process is documented, covering techniques for handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical data, and managing the imbalanced nature of the dataset's target variable (CSAT Score). Three distinct machine learning models are implemented and evaluated: a Logistic Regression baseline, a robust RandomForest Classifier, and a high-performance XGBoost Classifier. Hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV is performed on the RandomForest model to optimize its performance. The models are compared based on key classification metrics, with the tuned Random Forest selected as the final model for its strong balance of precision and recall. The project concludes by saving the best-performing model for potential deployment and summarizing the actionable business insights derived from both the EDA and the predictive models."

        "The primary business problem is to leverage customer support data to gain a deep, analytical understanding of customer satisfaction drivers and to build a predictive tool for proactive customer service. While raw data exists, there is a need to translate it into actionable business intelligence. This involves answering key questions through EDA: What are the main reasons for customer contact? Which support channels are most effective? Do factors like agent experience or item price impact satisfaction? Following the exploratory phase, the challenge is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict which customer interactions are likely to result in low satisfaction. This predictive capability would enable the support team to intervene proactively, potentially turning negative experiences into positive ones, thereby improving customer retention and brand loyalty."

A preliminary check reveals significant data quality issues: there are 5,320 duplicate entries and substantial missing data in columns like `connected_handling_time`, `Customer_City`, and several agent-related fields. This indicates that a thorough data wrangling phase will be essential before any meaningful analysis or modeling can be performed."

Specifically, the `class_weight='balanced'` parameter was set in the ML models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) or `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost. This mode automatically adjusts the weights of each class inversely proportional to their frequencies. This means the model's algorithm will pay much more attention to the minority class ('Low Satisfaction') during training, effectively punishing it more for making mistakes on those rare cases. This is a simple yet powerful technique that doesn't require resampling the data (like SMOTE) and can be easily implemented within the model itself."

After hyperparameter tuning, it often achieves a high F1-score, indicating this balance. Furthermore, its ability to provide clear feature importances is a significant advantage for deriving actionable business insights, making it not just a black box predictor but also an explanatory tool. XGBoost is a close competitor and may achieve slightly higher performance, but the tuned Random Forest is a robust, reliable, and more easily interpretable choice for this business problem."

        "This project successfully navigated the entire data science lifecycle, from initial data exploration and cleaning to the implementation and optimization of multiple predictive models. The EDA phase provided crucial insights, confirming high overall customer satisfaction while pinpointing specific areas like 'Refund Related' issues that require attention. The subsequent machine learning phase translated these insights into a powerful predictive tool. The tuned **RandomForest Classifier** emerged as the best-performing model, demonstrating high accuracy and, more importantly, a strong ability to recall the minority class ('Low Satisfaction'), which is vital for the business objective of proactive intervention. The feature importance analysis further validated the EDA findings, highlighting that the nature of the customer's issue (`category` and `Sub-category`) is a dominant predictor of their satisfaction. In conclusion, this project delivers not just a predictive model, but a comprehensive, data-driven strategy that Flipkart can use to maintain its high service standards and efficiently address potential points of customer friction."
