The primary goal is to derive actionable insights from customer interaction data to enhance service quality and operational efficiency. The analysis begins with data loading and an extensive cleaning process, where missing values are imputed using median and mode strategies, and data types are corrected to ensure data integrity for analysis. The core of the project involves a structured visualization approach following the Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate (UBM) rule.\n","\n","Univariate analysis focuses on understanding the distribution of key individual variables, such as Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores, the volume of requests per support channel, and the breakdown of inquiries by category. This reveals that customer satisfaction is generally very high, with most responses being a '5'. Bivariate analysis then explores the relationships between pairs of variables, such as the impact of the support channel, agent shift, and agent tenure on CSAT scores. Key findings indicate that while all channels perform well, some exhibit greater variance in satisfaction scores. Finally, a multivariate analysis using a correlation heatmap is performed on the numerical features to identify any underlying relationships between them, showing a moderate positive correlation between item price and handling time.\n","\n","The insights gathered are synthesized to provide concrete, data-driven recommendations aimed at addressing business objectives. These include focusing on process improvements for the most frequent inquiry categories (like order-related issues) and monitoring channels with higher satisfaction variance.

Why did you pick the specific chart?\n","A **treemap** is an excellent choice for visualizing hierarchical data.

It's more engaging and informative than a simple stacked bar chart for this purpose.\n","\n","##### 2. What is/are the insight(s) found from the chart?\n","The treemap provides a granular view of the most common issues.

For \"Product Queries,\" the sub-category **\"Product quality\"** is the most significant.\n","\n","##### 3. Will the gained insights help creating a positive business impact?\n","**Positive Business Impact:** This is extremely actionable. Instead of just targeting the broad \"Order Related\" category, the business can now focus on specific sub-problems.

This allows for precise, targeted interventions."],"metadata":{"id":"UV0SzAkaZNRQ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Chart - 15: CSAT vs. Price, by Channel (Multivariate)"],"metadata":{"id":"q29F0dvdveiT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["sns.lmplot(data=df_cleaned, x='Item_price', y='CSAT Score',\n","           hue='channel_name',\n","           height=7, aspect=1.5,\n","           scatter_kws={'alpha':0.1}, # Make points transparent to see density\n","           x_jitter=True, y_jitter=True)\n","plt.title('CSAT Score vs. Item Price, by Channel', fontsize=16)\n","plt.xlabel('Item Price', fontsize=12)\n","plt.ylabel('CSAT Score', fontsize=12)\n","plt.xlim(0, df_cleaned['Item_price'].quantile(0.95)) # Limit for readability\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"o58-TEIhveiU"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### 1. Why did you pick the specific chart?\n","A **faceted scatter plot (`lmplot`)** is a powerful multivariate visualization.

Satisfaction is high across the board, whether the item is cheap or expensive.\n","\n","##### 3.

Solution to Business Objective**"],"metadata":{"id":"JcMwzZxoAimU"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["To achieve the business objective of enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency, the client should implement the following data-driven strategies:\n","\n","1.  **Focus on High-Volume Categories:** The analysis shows that 'Order Related' issues are the most frequent cause for customer contact. The business should prioritize process improvements in this area. Streamlining order tracking, cancellation, and return procedures could significantly reduce the volume of support tickets, freeing up agent time for more complex issues.\n","\n","2.  **Optimize and Promote Digital Channels:** While 'Inbound' calls are the most popular channel, digital channels like 'Chat' are more scalable and cost-effective. The business should investigate why 'Chat' has a higher variance in CSAT scores. By implementing targeted quality control and training for the chat team, they can improve consistency and then actively promote the chat channel to customers as a reliable and efficient option.\n","\n","3.  **Specialize Training for High-Value Items:** The correlation between `Item_price` and `connected_handling_time` suggests that complex inquiries about expensive products take longer. The client should consider creating a specialized support queue or providing advanced training to a dedicated group of agents for handling high-value item inquiries. This would reduce handling time and improve the experience for high-value customers.\n","\n","4.  **Leverage Consistent Performance:** The fact that service quality is consistent across all shifts is a major strength. This reliability can be used as a key performance indicator (KPI) and a point of pride for the support team, reinforcing the high standards of service."],"metadata":{"id":"pASKb0qOza21"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Conclusion**"],"metadata":{"id":"gCX9965dhzqZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["In conclusion, this Exploratory Data Analysis of the Flipkart Customer Support dataset confirms that the support team is performing at an exceptionally high level, evidenced by the overwhelmingly positive Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores. The analysis successfully identified the primary drivers of customer interactions, with 'Order Related' issues being the most significant.\n","\n","The data indicates that while traditional 'Inbound' calls remain the most-used support channel, there is an opportunity to enhance and promote more efficient digital channels like 'Chat'. Key operational factors such as agent shift and tenure do not negatively impact the consistently high quality of service, pointing to a robust training and management system. The moderate relationship between item price and call duration offers a specific area for targeted efficiency improvements through specialized agent training.\n","\n","Ultimately, the insights from this EDA provide a clear, data-driven roadmap for the business to not only maintain its high standards of customer satisfaction but also to make strategic improvements that will enhance operational efficiency and further solidify customer loyalty."],"metadata":{"id":"Fjb1IsQkh3yE"}}]}
